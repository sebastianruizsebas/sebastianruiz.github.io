Its been about three weeks since my last post about CompNeuroSociety Project Development. Since then there has been some action: 
- Dr. Pena will give a workshop to CNS Students on June 27th at 2PM.
- Harthik from UConn will partner with us to make a sister organization

However our projects are still under development. Last night I met virtually with Upi, Andre, and Hafsa to talk about projects for CNS and I brought up an idea I had about bringing in general members to help us develop projects. Andre had another really good idea about calling it a "Projects Onboarding Meeting/Discussion"

I think this is a really great opportunity to release some weight off our shoulders to develop projects, and include assistance from people who might be interested. Andre added another idea to at the end host an open mic to hear member's ideas of potential directions we could take.
