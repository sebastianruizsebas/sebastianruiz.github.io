I joined Andre and Harthik virtually through zoom to discuss the project onboarding meeting that we will host after the Pena Lab workshop. I found out about this cool Zoom AI meeting summary tool which I used, here are the notes: [Download Doc]( {{ 'assets/files/CNS_meeting_sum_6_12_25.docx' | relative_url }} )

We will meet again this upcoming Thursday to further discuss our materials for our Project Onboarding meeting. This meeting will be open to general members of CNS and UCNS and so we want to be prepared for that in order to get people engaged. But I feel we shouldn't rush this, because we want this to come out smoothly and also we want Harthik's organization to be present for it too. It would be nice if we do it before the summer ends but okay if not.
