I ended up not meeting with Andre or Upi that Monday due to something that came up. Andre said he is following up with Morgan or the NTX contact to see exactly how CNS will be involved in a TVB-related project.

I reached out to Dr. Pena at FAU who does work in computational neuroscience to see if he'd be interested in a collaboration for CNS, he seemed very interested in the idea of his team providing workshops/seminars for CNS students. He said he would reach back out to me to touch base once he talks it through with his team. If something comes up and he changes his mind, I will ask him for advice on some potential collaborative undergraduate projects we could take on within the field of computational neuroscience.

I assume he will say that it will be good to identify what areas of computational neuroscience we will like to work in, and so it might help to survey members of CNS for their interests because I don't think my initial member registration form really worked for that. But if we don't do the survey by the time I meet with him, I will ask him for advice anyways for potential project ideas.

We have professors in the list with research interests vaguely scattered around computational neuroscience but not within computational neuroscience directly (except for 3-5).
1. If we are to reach out without a research project in mind, it would have to be with those professors that have research interests in computational neuroscience, since their work already aligns with the field, and we don't want to take on a project that isnt related to our interests
2. If the professors field is not within comp neuro, then we should see how their interests can apply to a project, which requires a project in mind.

I think I will wait until I speak with Dr. Pena and/or do the survey to email those 3-5 professors. From there, we should have a vague idea of the projects already and then we'll be able to reach out to adjacent professors for support (through workshops, etc)
