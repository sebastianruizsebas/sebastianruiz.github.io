I want to find an Honors in the Major advisor in the Department of Statistics. I don't feel too confident in my ability to do statistics right now, so the goal is for that to change. 

I spoke with Dr. Shows about finding a willing advisor and he suggested to look on the faculty listing page for the stats department and go from there. So far Wei Wu's research looks pretty interesting, he has published in the Springer Journal of Computational Neuroscience in 2011, where he cites Rob Kass.
