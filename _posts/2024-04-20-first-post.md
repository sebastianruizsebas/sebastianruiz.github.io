The goal of this website is to document my journey, and to express myself. Of course, I want to maintain an online presence that at the end of the day is employable, so I will try to stay away from political posts. Nowadays though, more and more things are being dragged into political arguments so I will say my opinion is my own and does not reflect any entity I am affiliated with.
