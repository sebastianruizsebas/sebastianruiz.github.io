<p>I was born and raised in South Florida, and I am currently living in Tallahassee while I work on my Bachelor's degree in Statistics with minors in Computational Science and Psychology.
My goal is to earn a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, Statistics, or both (I'm looking at you, CMU...). I enjoy nerdy stuff like underground rap music and japanese minimal ambient music, london fog teas, and walks in the park with my girlfriend.
I did an internship at Carnegie Mellon University</p>
