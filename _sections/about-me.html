<p>I was born and raised in South Florida, and I am currently living in Tallahassee while I work on my Bachelor's degree in Statistics with minors in Computational Science and Psychology.
My goal is to earn a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, Statistics, or both (I'm looking at you, CMU...). I enjoy nerdy stuff like underground rap music and japanese minimal ambient music, london fog teas, and walks in the park with my girlfriend.
I did an internship at Carnegie Mellon University in computational neuroscience, but I'm eager to learn more and dive deeper. This summer I'll be joining Brown University as a Carney Summer Scholar working with Dr. Mohamed Sherif with tools like
Monty by the Thousand Brains Project. </p>
