<p>I'm from South Florida, and I currently live in Tallahassee while I work on my Bachelor's degree in Statistics, with minors in Computational Science and Psychology.
I enjoy nerdy stuff like underground rap music and japanese minimal ambient music, london fog teas, and walks through nature with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>My goal is to earn a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, Statistics, or both (I'm looking at you, CMU...). I did an internship at Carnegie Mellon University in computational neuroscience, 
but I'm eager to learn more and keep learning. This summer, I'll be joining Brown University as a Carney Summer Scholar working with Dr. Mohamed Sherif with tools like
Monty by the Thousand Brains Project.</p>
<p>I founded CompNeuroSociety at FSU in 2025 out of a desire to build a community around computational neuroscience at my current institution, and to build an avenue to keep developing my skills in my preferred field of study.</p>
